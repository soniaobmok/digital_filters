# digital_filters
Here is a program for visual comparsion of some adaptive digital filters. 
It affords to generate a representation of linear and sine types of signals with some level of noise. Then, you can choose some of three digital filters - Kalman filter, FIR filter or LMS filter to filtrate the signal.
A program will graphically show the results of filtration.
